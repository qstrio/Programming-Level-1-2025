/*
A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task.
You define a function once, and you can call it as many times as you need.

Here's the basic structure of a function:
*/

func greet() {
    print("Hello, World!")
}

/*
In this example:
- `func` is the keyword to define a function.
- `greet` is the function name.
- `{}` is where you place the code that the function will execute.

To call the function, you simply use the function's name followed by parentheses:
*/

greet()  // This will print: "Hello, World!"


/*
Sometimes, you want to pass information into a function.
That's where parameters come in. Parameters are like placeholders that let you pass in data.

Let’s define a function that takes a name as a parameter:
*/

func greet(name: String) {
    print("Hello, \(name)!")
}

// Call the function and pass in a value for the parameter:
greet(name: "Alice")  // This will print: "Hello, Alice!"


/*
Functions can also return a value. For example, let's define a function that adds two numbers together and returns the result.

Here’s how you can define a function with a return value:
*/

func addNumbers(a: Int, b: Int) -> Int {
    return a + b
}

// Calling the function and using the returned value:
let sum = addNumbers(a: 10, b: 5)
print(sum)  // This will print: 15

/*
Now it's your turn! Create a function that:
- Takes two numbers as parameters.
- Returns the product of those two numbers.

Example:
Create a function called `multiplyNumbers` that multiplies two numbers and returns the result.
*/

func quadilateralArea(length: Int, width: Int) -> Int {
    length * width
}



// Test your function:

print("The area of a 4x5 rectangle is \(quadilateralArea(length: 4, width: 5))")

/*
Now try creating a few more functions of your own!
- Create a function that takes two numbers and returns their difference.
- Create a function that takes a string and prints a personalized greeting.
*/

func subtractNumbers(num1: Int, num2: Int) -> String {
    "\(num1)-\(num2) is equal to \(num1-num2)"
}

print(subtractNumbers(num1: 8, num2: 2))

func sayHello(name: String = "John") -> String {
    "Hello, \(name)! Welcome to our app!"
}

print(sayHello(name:"jasdfghjkl"))
