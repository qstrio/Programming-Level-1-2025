# Programming Level 1

## Contents

This repository contains code that was created during Programming Level 1 in Grade 11. 

Most of the code is in Swift, and the main framework used in class was SwiftUI. 

This also contains the app I developed. The wireframe and pitch deck I used during *Final Showcase* in June 2025 are included in the folder **PracticeNest**.

## Context

During the semester, I learned how to code in Swift. Throughout the term, I was taught how to pt together a wireframe in Keynote. Then, I attempted to translate those ideas from Keynote into an actual app using Swift, but there was no time in the pitch for such a demonstration, so I never followed through with the idea.
